After various causes for delay it finally arrived last Friday (April 4th). It was supposed to be a winter project, but now it might be ready in time for the bad winter weather!</p>
          <p>Having not built a model since I was 16, I thought it best to start with a kit. Not an 'almost ready to fly' type that just needs assembly and the addition of motor and servos, but something with a plan and sheets of balsa and ply, albeit with the shaped parts die-cut or laser-cut. From an RC flying point of view I wanted to move up slightly from my high-wing trainer, but I wanted something that was semi-scale. And I wanted to try electric power. So I chose the Great Planes' Piper J-3 ElectriCub. At 1.49m wingspan it is only a little smaller than my IC trainer and so should fit easily into our small car.</p>

          <p>The plans appear to be well drawn, with good detail, and the instructions look comprehensive. Time will tell if these first impressions are right. I bought a decent hobby knife, a razor saw and a razor plane, together with some thin CA and 5-minute epoxy (I already had medium CA and 30-minute epoxy) and started my build. I decided to try some baking parchment as a plan protector. Although it is brown, it seems to be sufficiently transparent.</p>
          <p>These pages (listed in the panel on the right) record not only my progress, but also the problems that I encounter and, hopefully, my solutions.</p>
