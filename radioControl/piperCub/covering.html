I bought a small roll of Solartex in Cub Yellow and a thermal sealing iron. Solartex had been recommended by several club members and since it already has an adhesive coating it seems like a good choice. The adhesive melts at a lower temperature than the fabric shrinks, so you can fix it in place first and then shrink it. My trials with a simple open frame (with rounded edges) and a solid piece of balsa seemed to work quite well. The iron comes with a 'sock', which helps make the process seem more controlled.</p>

Other things just got in the way. At present I still have the wing struts and the landing gear fairings to cover.</p>

              <img src="images/Covering.jpg" style="width: 300px; float: right; position: relative; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px"></a>I am amazed at the flexibility of the Solartex material. Even with my inexperience I was able to cover the awkwardly shaped back of the fuselage, but I could not remove all the wrinkles where the Solartex turns under at the wing tips. I also found that a cut edge overlapping another piece of fabric is quite visible. So where this was going to happen I started tearing the fabric so as to produce a less defined edge. Being a woven fabrics, once you have removed the backing, it tears along the weave and so produces a straight edge.</p>
              <p>My only disappointment is the transparency of the material. It took me a while to decide to go with Cub yellow, but I was surprised how much of the underlying structure shows through. This also means that marks on the structure show through and spoil the appearance.</p>
