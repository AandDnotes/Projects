          <h3>First Flight</h3>
          <p>The day finally arrived. I am definitely a fine weather flyer. Even when it is quite warm at home, up on the South Downs it can be quite chilly and certainly a lot windier. Anyway, last Tuesday (7th April 2015) I took both planes up to the flying site. It was a calm, sunny day and I counted at least 17 club members up there.</p>
          <p>I didn't really want an audience, but both Alan (who had trained me to fly) and Les were there and they helped me check the plane. I firstly flew my IC trainer a couple of times, just to get my eye in. This was, after all, my first visit to the site since November and I still have difficulty lining up for landing and getting the plane where I want it on the strip. So I bent the front wheel leg again on my second landing.</p>
          <p>Anyway, I couldn't put off the Cub's maiden flight any longer. Alan stood beside me to give advice and adjust trims. After an attempt at taxiing, where I found the rudder/tail wheel to be very sensitive, I took off. All went well. The Cub was quite stable and flew at a reasonable speed on only half throttle. I made several passes where I let go of the controls so that we could adjust the trims. After a while it was flying in a straight line, although it was affected by quite a strong breeze. Although I landed on the far side of the strip, I at least got it down gently and in one piece.</p>
          <p>I forgot to set my timer (an app on my phone, which I set to 'flight' mode), but we guessed that I had been airborne for 6-7 minutes. When I checked the battery it was down to 16%! By this time it was getting late and I decided to quit while I was ahead, in spite of have another fully charged battery.</p>
          <p>I will probably give it another flight or two before I tackle the decoration. It was quite tricky getting both planes and accessories into the car, so I might just take the Cub next time.</p>
          <h3>A Few More Flights</h3>
          <p>My next couple of flights were fine. However, whilst trying to taxi, the wheels stuck in the grass and the plane tipped forward causing the prop to hit the ground. I didn't notice any problem until I took off again. As the plane was passing I heard a strange noise, so I landed quickly. It seems that the prop hitting the ground had broken the motor mount and the plane was effectively being pulled through the air by the cowl! I had always been concerned about the  slightness of the mount.</p>
          <p>I will also need to ensure that I have some up-elevator when taxiing and starting to take off.</p>
