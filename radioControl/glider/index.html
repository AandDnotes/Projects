                <p>At the SRFC auction on Friday 7th April 2017 I bought a glider for £10. It had a brushless motor, an ESC and two servos, but needed a battery and receiver.</p>
                <p>The plastic fuselage looks like a Nine Eagles Sky Surfer, but the wings may be home made. However, it does look as though the motor has been added at some time. The basic specification for the model is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wingspan: 69.25” (176 cm)</li>
                    <li>Motor: J Perkins 400L O/R 1220 (C28-16) Brushless Motor (available new for £46, see <a href="http://jperkins.com/400l-o-r-1220-c28-16-brushless-motor">here</a>)</li>
                    <li>ESC: E-pro SP-50A-AIR (available new for £49)</li>
                    <li>Servos: Futaba S3003, 2-off, one for elevator and one for rudder (currently £8.99 each from SMC, £3.42 from DX.com), nylon gears</li>
                </ul>
                <p><img src="images/DSC_3587.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 268px; float: right; position: relative; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px">So I bought a Lemon 6-ch DSMX compatible receiver for £14.45 off eBay and a 2S 2200 mAh LiPo for £13 from SMC.</p>
                <p>As can be seen in the photo, the battery has a female Deans connector, but the ESC has bullet connectors. So I put a male Deans connector on the ESC and moved the switch so that there was room for the battery under the canopy.</p>
                <p>Under the wing, the plane already had short plastic tubes taped to the fuselage at right angles to each other for redundant antenae. So I put the receiver in foam at the front of the wing area and put the antenae in these two tubes. Having created a new model in the transmitter I bound the receiver to it and adjusted the linkage to the rudder so as to remove the need for trim.</p>
                <p>After my first visit to the flying site with the glider (on Wednesday 5th July 2017) I discovered that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ESC was not configured to activate the motor brake. Consequently the motor free-wheeled as it was moving through the air, rather than folding.</li>
                    <li>My two cell battery does not provide enough voltage to produce the required rpm. Also, the ESC was configured to cut the motor if the voltage was too low. So the motor would not run for longer than a few seconds.</li>
                    <li>I needed to configure one of the switches to cut the motor so that I could do that when the glider reached the required height, without needing to worry about the stick position.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I borrowed a three cell battery from Peter Plank and Gordon gave the glider a trial flight. I had arranged to try flying the club's glider, but Gordon had only brought one of the wings! His only suggestion was that I should move the CofG a little further forward so as to make it more stable.</p>
                <p>Enabling the brake on the ESC was easy, even if the instruction sheet is a little obscure. However, after much research I found that it is not possible on the Spektrum DX6i transmitter to link the throttle to one of the switches. It can be done for the flying surfaces by mixing them, but I couldn't cut the throttle. There is already a throttle cut button, but it is a momentary contact, really designed to cut an IC engine.</p>
                <p><img src="images/ThrottleCutButton.jpg" style="float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px"><img src="images/ThrottleCutSwitch.jpg" style="float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px">The photos above show my solution. The first shows the standard throttle cut button and the second shows it replaced with a toggle switch. It was necessary to remove one of the fixing pillars for the button PCB, but this was easily done with side cutters. So, although the throttle control is still on the stick, I now have a switch that can turn the motor off.</p>
