        <h1>DSO 138 Oscilloscope DIY Kit Build</h1>
        <p><img src="images/DSC_3590.jpg" style="float: right; width: 600px; height: 671px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px">When 'playing' with microcontrollers, servos and other electronics I often thought it would be usefulto have an oscilloscope. However, I couldn't really justify either the cost or the space that such a tool would take. So at the end of August in 2016 I bought a DSO 138 Oscilloscope DIY kit from GearBest for Â£14.31, including an acrylic case and delivery, as an early Christmas present. The JYE Tech device only has a 2.4" screen, but for low accuracy and low frequency signals it should be fine.</p>
        <p>The kit comes with a PCB with surface mount components, including the microcontroller, already soldered in place. Similalrly, the TFT screen is already attached to the screen PCB. There is then a bag of bits. Basically all the through-hole components.</p>
        <p>The first photo shows the board after I had soldered all the components to the board. The instructions basically led you through, by component type. So all the resistors were soldered in place first, then the diodes, etc.</p>
        <p>The second photo shows the device powered up (using a 9V battery) and showing the in-built test signal.<img src="images/DSC_3589.jpg" style="float: right; width: 600px; height: 401px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px"></p>
        <p>The final photo shows the same signal, but with the oscilloscope in its acrylic box. I had to file the bolt holes and glue a broken pice of acrylic to which the screen is bolted. So the simple process of slotting together the pieces and bolting them together took most of an afternoon.<img src="images/DSC_3595.jpg" style="float: right; width: 600px; height: 401px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px"></p>
