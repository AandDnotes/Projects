                <h1>The Fine Weather Cyclist</h1>
                <p>When the request went out for another member of the Control Pedlars, that hardy band of cyclists that ride from London to Brighton each year, there was no mention of the departure from Crawley at five in the morning. So being a 'fine weather' cyclist in need of a little encouragement to get on my bike, the idea of a ride at the end of June seemed quite appealing. And there was still six weeks to prepare my unfit body.</p>
                <p>I had been cycling the 'long way' to the paper shop each weekend, about seven miles with a hill or two, but it was after my first 15 mile ride that apprehension first surfaced. It took a long hot bath and plenty of cream around the saddle area to help my recovery. How was I going to survive 58 miles? To solve the bruising I finally succumbed to padded shorts and then to padded pants as well. I was up to 26 miles and feeling a real sense of achievement when a lycra clad figure passed me, and as he shouted "Good morning" I could detect the Doppler effect! However, I achieved some satisfaction when I managed to cycle to the top of the Downs without a stop. My legs and lungs were improving but there was still the early start to face.</p>
                <p>All I had to do was shift my day forward a few hours so that I could get up at 3.45 in the morning to get to Crawley before five and our scheduled departure from Clapham Common at 6.30. However, I wasn't tired when I went to bed early and other members of the household, including the dog, stuck to their normal hours, encouraging my insomnia. So by the time we reached the start, amongst all these professional looking cyclists, I was feeling in need of a good nights sleep. I was also wondering why it was that I had a full rucksack on my back, complete with tracksuit and waterproofs as per the official guidance, when most others had a small bag under their saddle! Did they have the latest in high-tech clothing rolled up in a saddlebag or had they learnt from previous London to Brighton runs?</p>
                <p>The ride out of London was very gentle due to the sheer number of cyclists but I soon lost sight of the rest of the team. It was easy going, however, and quite reassuring when we reached the first real hill and lots of cyclists were walking. Much to my surprise I reached our first rendezvous point, having already cycled further than ever before, pretty much on schedule, although I do now know why it is called Turners hill! There I found the leading group and was surprised that others were behind me.</p>
                <p>Good planning by the team meant two more stops before the dreaded Ditchling, a most welcome one of which included chocolate croissants and orange squash at Hillary's pit stop. However, in spite of the croissants, there seemed to be no energy left in my legs by Ditchling village.</p>
                <p>I had already cycled twice as far as ever before and Ditchling Beacon is higher than I had previously climbed. Somehow though my legs were in automatic and I was over half way up before finally my breath ran out and I had to stop, weaving between the walkers to find a resting place at the edge of the road. It took a few minutes to regain a more normal breathing rate and having got that far I was determined to ride the rest of the way. It was good to see the other, fitter, members of the team at the top and the ride down into Brighton was exhilarating. The most difficult part was mixing with the heavy traffic in Brighton but seeing the outline of the Palace Pier was a sight for sore â€¦. parts of the body.</p>
                <p>I have always had great admiration for marathon runners but, for us less able beings, cycling to the finish line with crowds of clapping spectators on either side, is probably the nearest that we will get. Just getting that stamp on my card made it all worthwhile.</p>
                <p>Would I do it again? At the moment, with the elation fresh in my mind, yes. But I will have to see how good my memory is next May. But my hat goes off to the gentleman who rode a penny-farthing all the way from Clapham Common to Brighton. I hope that he was well sponsored.</p>
