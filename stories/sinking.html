                <h1>That Sinking Feeling</h1>
                <p>Finding an open tin of pilchards and a saucer of milk in the gutter might at first seem unusual. Considering the events of the previous three months, however, we took this in our stride, discussing it alongside the relevance of visits from the new owner of the adjoining wood waving solicitor’s letters.</p>
                <p>The events leading to the fishy snack started four and a half years ago when we moved from Cheshire to a small town in the folds of the South Downs. We had been living in a three story Victorian semi with large, high ceilinged rooms and complete with cellar. Although not a large family, we had got used to the space that our 1898 built house had afforded and, at the peak of housing market values, found few houses of substance that we could afford. We eventually bought a bungalow, at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac and next to the afore-mentioned wood, that had been extended and thus offered conveniently arranged and just about adequate space. Even so we had to sell some of the extra pieces of furniture that we had acquired and buy fitted wardrobes to make better use of the available space</p>
                <p>If a wider choice of properties had been available the discovery of signs of settlement in one part of the extension would probably have caused us to look elsewhere. However, following trial holes to examine foundations we bought the place and started the usual process of updating the kitchen and decorating rooms.</p>
                <p>The story between then and the start of the work to demolish part of the extension and rebuild it from the foundations up is long and tortuous and best left for another occasion. Suffice to say that during the next three years repaired mortar joints and hairline cracks turned into jagged chasms and yawning gaps. The only person to relish the period was our structural engineer who used photographs of our walls during lectures as examples of classic subsidence.</p>
                <p>Despite our efforts to get the work carried out during the autumn months the builder finally arrived on site during November. It would be tight, he said, but they should be able to get all but the decoration done by Christmas. Luckily we had contingency plans. Since moving south it has become the tradition for family members to spend Christmas with us. With the dining room and the study now doubling as children's bedrooms our ability to put up visitors was severely restricted. However, my parent's house, just six miles drive away over the Downs, would be vacant and so the plan was that three of us would sleep there, giving up our rooms to our guests. When we made the plans the thought of driving to one’s bed each evening over Christmas did not sound too onerous. Add the practicalities of not being able to partake in festive cheer and the result was much more sobering!</p>
                <p>Needles to say, building progress was not as suggested. The building came down quickly enough but a few days of bad weather and the non-appearance of the tiler left us with polythene sheets covering the roof over the Christmas period. And what happened over Christmas? The wind blew and the rains came down. In spite of attempts to tie down the temporary roof covering, our return home on Boxing Day morning found water running from the light fitting in one bedroom and a rather soggy mattress. Consolation, if any could be found, came in the form of calling out the builder on Boxing Day to help batten down the roof!</p>
