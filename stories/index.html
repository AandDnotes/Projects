                <h1>Stories - Real and Fictional</h1>
                <p>Over the years I've put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard to write things. Sometimes it was an account of something that had happened and sometimes it was just some fictional story. I guess, like many, I've always had an ambition to write, if only I had the talent. Successful, published writers say that it is hard work. They put a lot of effort into honing their skills and then keep a strict discipline when it comes to writing a story. I, on the other hand, simply try to write when something comes to mind, expecting it to produce something that others would like to read. It doesn't really work!</p>
                <p>In 2012, a year before I retired, I tried writing some short stories. This was prompted by a competition run by the Daily Telegraph newspaper, the winning story each month being published in the Saturday edition. I didn't win! It seems a pity to leave these texts hidden on my hard drive, so I've added them here. You can find out why I didn't win.</p>
                <p>Apart from my 'journal' and the various articles that I've written for publications, my attempts at writing (that I can still find) are listed and available here. Sometimes there is a litle duplication where I have reused some text or a theme.</p>
