                <h1>Frequent Flyer</h1>
                <p>By most people's standards I would be considered a frequent flyer. I've never managed to earn an airline's gold card, but I've had a silver card for some years and at one time had silver cards from two separate airlines! Most of my flights from the UK are across the Atlantic, with a sprinkling of flights to the Middle East and Far East, plus a few to European destinations. This amount of travel comes about because I work for a company that has offices in most industrialised countries and a head office in the US. This means, of course, that I arrive at an airport, usually in the dark, take a taxi to a hotel, which usually looks like any other hotel, travel through modern suburbs, which could be in any city, to a carbon copy office and retrace my steps in the evening, in the dark. I don't want to sound hard done by, but I rarely get a chance to see anything of the places that I visit. Eighteen months ago I did get half a day to explore Tokyo and last November I managed an hour to look at a bit of Bratislava. Mind you, I couldn't see the opposite bank of the Danube for the fog. I once had a weekend free in Huntsville, Alabama. Now I've nothing against Huntsville, but when the second attraction on the top ten things to do in Huntsville is a shop that sells lost airline baggage, you can perhaps have some sympathy.</p>
                <p>I mention these points because it illustrates that I am an experienced traveller. I know my way around Gatwick and Heathrow airports, particularly Terminal 5, and understand the process of international travel. Where I can, I only take carry-on luggage (if I need clothes for more than five days then I use the hotel laundry) and I ensure that I have my passport, my ticket (which these days is usually electronic) and money. The latter is generally a combination of some cash in the appropriate currency and a company credit card. I avoid carrying sharp objects and I always have a few tablets to combat diarrhoea, just in case.</p>
                <p>And so, when I set off to travel to California for three days of meetings I was my usual, organised, calm self. My passport was in my shirt pocket, details of my flight were on my iPad and I had US dollars in my wallet plus credit cards. Some years ago, whilst in Houston I had my laptop case stolen. If that was not bad enough (my life was in that laptop), my passport was also in the case! One problem with the US is that you need photo id to do anything, and my passport was the only image of myself that I was carrying. Because I had no photo id, the down-town Houston police station would not let me in so as to report that my passport had been stolen! Since that time I always keep my passport on my person, either in my shirt pocket, as on this occasion, or in a body belt. If I go to the gym or pool then I put my trust in the hotel room safe.</p>
                <p>Trips to the US usually mean an overnight return flight. I don't sleep well on planes and so I'm in no fit state to drive home from Heathrow. Therefore a car collected me at seven o'clock in the morning and took me to Terminal 5. The M25 can be unpredictable at that time of the morning, so I had left plenty of time and, with no holdups, arrived nearly three hours before my departure time. I was ready for a light breakfast in the airline lounge; one of the perks that goes with a silver card. Have you noticed that airlines now get you to do all the work? You go to a machine to check in and print your boarding pass, then take your luggage to a 'bag-drop'. I tried to check in at a machine, only to be told that I needed to go to a service desk. Now that is usually a good sign. It often means that you have been upgraded. Our company rules say that a flight needs to be longer than ten hours before we can 'request' a business class ticket. Heathrow to LA is just over ten hours, but rules are there to be broken and no one will authorise business class travel for transatlantic journeys! However, I can often swing 'premium economy', which I had on this occasion, and that meant that an upgrade would put me in business; a comfortable seat, a watchable video screen, a wine glass made of glass, real china and metal cutlery. The already sunny day was looking brighter and brighter.</p>
                <p>So I went to a service desk, took my passport from my pocket, opened it at the photo page and saw my wife's face staring back at me!</p>
                <p>You know those events where a sudden shock makes you feel physically sick? Well this was one of them. An uneasy feeling of panic and a giddiness in the head. My face must have turned white since the woman behind the desk asked if I was feeling well! How do you admit that you have brought the wrong passport and still retain any sense of dignity? Oh, here we go again; another idiot that has screwed up his travel plans. Here I was, one and half hours from home with no transport and two and a half hours before my flight. And the woman confirmed that I had been upgraded.</p>
                <p>If you are thinking rationally then the solution is obvious, even though the timing would be tight. However, when you are still in a state of shock it takes a while to go through the options in your head, cross out the ones that will not work and, hopefully, leave one on the list. I walked over to one of the few seats that flank one edge of the departures hall in Terminal 5, sat and started to think how I would start the conversation with my wife. She had not driven on the M25 past Heathrow since the road had been widened and she had never been to Terminal 5.</p>
                <p>I like to think that I direct our lives along a steady route, but I suspect that my wife does a good job of allowing be to believe that I make the decisions. I have noticed in the past that, while I am struggling with decision dilemmas, she prompts me with the most logical option. So it shouldn't have surprised me when she found my passport in my bedside cabinet draw and asked how to find Terminal 5 and how to find me.</p>
                <p>So it was that I found myself sitting in a cafe in the departures hall rather than sitting in an airline lounge with my boarding pass in my pocket. I was trying to digest a croissant and mug of coffee, still with a queasy feeling in my stomach, rather than reading the morning paper. Would the M25 be snarled up by this time of the morning? Would she miss the Terminal 5 turn off the M25? Would she take the wrong fork and end up in the short-term car park rather than in the departures drop-off lane? Eating some semblance of breakfast didn't make the time pass any easier. So I walked out of the departures hall to the drop-off area where I had been left by my taxi one and half hours earlier and headed for the entrance, just at the top of the ramp where drivers need to decide which lane to chose, the one nearest the terminal or the one with fewer cars. The approach ramp is curved, so from my waiting point I could not see approaching cars until they were almost upon me. That spot was also favoured by smokers having their last drag before hours of nicotine free travel. The atmosphere did not make me feel any better. Also, the first car length in the lay-by, although often empty since drivers wanted to take their passengers closer to the entrance, did have a steady stream of users.</p>
                <p>My wife's car is distinctive only in that it is not a popular model or colour. So when such a car came around the curve I knew it was her. I put out my arm as though requesting a bus to stop and she pulled into the vacant space at the start of the drop-off lane. We exchanged passports and a quick kiss and she drove off to return home, leaving me at the curb-side with my carry-on bag and my own passport. My hero! I did not, however, tell her that I had been upgraded.</p>
                <p>Now I was where I should have been two hours previous, but with only half an hour before my flight was due to depart. This time check-in at a service desk worked; security was a breeze (no belt or anything that would set off the metal detectors) and I know that the lift down to the train to the satellite terminals is faster than the escalators. I arrived at the gate as passengers were starting to board. As I sat back in my business class seat my fellow passengers would have seen no evidence of my earlier shame or of my salvation. I almost felt like accepting a glass of champagne, but I resisted and took a glass of apple juice before taking off for California.</p>
                <p>Thank goodness for the Internet florist!</p>
