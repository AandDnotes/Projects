                <h1>The Room at the Top</h1>
                <p>Blood dripping from the light fitting was not usual at number 27. In fact the Victorian terraced house, divided into three flats, was not known for being extraordinary in any way. You could walk past it and not really notice it was there; it simply merged into the terrace and if you asked a passer by to say how many houses were in the row they would likely say four, missing the one in the middle altogether. So when Frank saw a drip of dark red, viscous liquid fall to his threadbare carpet from the light bulb he realised that something unusual was happening. He didn't spend much time in his flat, preferring to have a pie and a pint at the local or a Chinese or Indian with his mates. In fact his flat hardly looked lived in, even though he had been there for nearly six months. He'd never really unpacked, his clothes going from holdall to body to laundrette and back to holdall. But this had the look of something that would keep him in his flat for a while. Had his landlady fallen on a knitting needle in the attic room or had her dog finally caught the cat and decapitated it in the room above? Perhaps Mrs Winterden had let the attic room to Sweeny Todd!</p>
                <p>Frank acted with uncharacteristic speed and went down stairs to tell Mrs W what he'd found. Walking past Mrs W's door could be dangerous. It was as if she was waiting behind the door, ready to pounce on anyone passing and insisting that they go in for a cup of tea and a chat. Frank often thought that she must have the kettle on the gas all the time, just in case. On this occasion, however, she did not pounce. In fact he could get no answer. He bounded to the top floor, only to find the door locked and so took his mobile phone from his pocket and dialled 999. Another unusual act for Frank. He was by no means a villain, but he had no liking for the police.</p>
                <p>Constable Purse put his shoulder to the door and the Victorian lock gave way. It was Detective Inspector Manor who entered first, but to everyone's surprise there was just a congealing pool of blood coloured liquid on the bare floorboards. Too large a pool for a decapitated cat. At that point they heard the front door being opened. "That will be Mrs W" said Frank, "Gerry doesn't get home until later". As soon as Mrs W saw the uniformed officer and who she assumed was a plain-clothed policeman coming down the stairs she went into her kitchen and put the kettle on.</p>
                <p>"Now drink your tea and then tell me what all this fuss is about." They all dutifully took a sip.</p>
                <p>"I've no idea how that could have got there. I've been at my friends house all afternoon, but I would have heard anyone going up stairs before I left. I've very good hearing." Frank nodded. "Mind you", said Mrs W, "I never keep the room locked in case one of the lads wants to store something up there. In fact I don't even think there's a key for it. And it's only Frank, Gerry and me that have keys for the front door. Apart, that is, for the one under the outside mat. Just in case one of the lads forgets theirs." Constable Purse scribbled into his note book, trying not to catch the Inspector's eye.</p>
                <p>By this time the forensic team had arrived, taping off 'no-go' areas, taking finger prints and photographs, and leaving surfaces covered in a fine white powder. They were pretty sure that it was human blood, but they would know for sure in the morning. "What's going on" said a voice from the doorway. "And who are you" said Constable Purse and DI Manor in unison. "That's Gerry, my other lodger" said Mrs W. "Come in love and have a cup of tea."</p>
                <p>While a fresh pot was brewing, DI Manor started collecting statements. Frank worked in the butchers department of a local supermarket. That's how he recognised the liquid as blood; although the meat he cuts up does not leak that much liquid. He finished early on a Wednesday and had walked home straight from work. He was 25 and this was his third job this year. He found it difficult to settle but was determined to stick at this one, since it would give him a trade. There was also a good range of female assistants and the occasional prime cut could work wonders. Although Mrs W referred to them both as lads, Gerry was in his mid fifties and wouldn't know what to do with a female shop assistant and a prime cut. He worked for an insurance company in the next town and caught the bus to and from work. When he went out it was mainly to model soldier exhibitions and staged battles. In spite of his shyness he was quite an accomplished strategist when it came to battling armies of five centimetre high figures. He'd never been in the room at the top he said, preferring to keep his models locked away in cupboards in his flat.</p>
                <p>Mrs W said that she had stopped counting birthdays after 80. Truth be known, she was only 69, but had the look of an octogenarian, with her slight, stoop frame and white hair tied back in a bun. She found that if people thought she was in her eighties they were far more helpful. She couldn't shed any light on the issue of the blood, but she wasn't surprised. She thought the area had really gone down hill over the past ten years. "There are loan sharks and prostitutes on every corner" she said.</p>
                <p>While she was at her friends she had heard of another poor sole who had borrowed money and then not been able to pay back the enormous interest charges. She thought that was were the police should be looking for the person who had left a pool of blood on her attic room floor. How was she going to get the stain out of poor Frank's carpet?</p>
                <p>Frank wasn't planning on spending the night in his flat, no matter whether the blood was human or animal. He would find a friend's sofa to sleep on for the next few nights. But before DI Manor would let him leave the house the DI wanted to take a quick look in each of the rooms. It was now safe to move around the house since the forensic people had finished.</p>
                <p>They started with Frank's flat, really just two rooms, a sitting room with a kitchen in the the corner, and a bedroom. He and Gerry shared a bathroom on the half landing. Constable Purse commented that Frank's flat looked as though he was about to do a runner, with his bag already packed. Gerry's flat was a similar arrangement, but with a separate small kitchen. However, it was much more 'lived in', with a TV and books on warfare and model soldiers. Mrs Winterden's ground floor was twice the size of the two first floor flats. Doors had been moved to make an inner hall giving access to a parlour, dining room, two bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom. The kitchen was large, with a butcher's block and small table, and a door into a concreted yard with brick-built storage sheds. It was said that these Victorian terraces had manholes that dropped twenty feet straight into the main sewers fro the town. Constable Purse gave each of the sheds a quick inspection while DI Manor asked about the large saw hanging on a hook in the kitchen. "My husband was a butcher and I keep that to cut up bones for Archie. Sometimes the bones are bigger than him and he does like to have a good knaw." The DI had detached Archie from his leg on a couple of occasions while seated in Mrs W's parlour. He wasnâ€™t a fan of dogs, particularly white dogs that moulted.</p>
                <p>Refusing another cup of tea, DI Manor took details of how Frank could be contacted, let him leave and then made his own escape. They would see what forensics had to say in the morning and then work out what to do. Gerry retreated to his flat to finish painting some cavalry officers from the Crimean War and Mrs W started preparing Archie's supper before preparing her own. She would microwave a 'ready meal' and eat it in front of the box. A new crime thriller was starting that evening.</p>
                <p>The blood had come from a man, and with that loss he was unlikely to be alive. However that was all the forensic team could tell them. After three days of scouring interview reports, photographs of the scene and missing persons reports Detective Inspector Manor had no where to go in his investigation. Without a body, or an identity to whom the missing body might have belonged, he could find neither motive nor opportunity. Besides, he couldn't stomach another cup of tea at Mrs W's. So the case went into the 'on hold pending further evidence' file.</p>
                <p>It was two weeks later that Mrs W heard a knock on the front door of the house. She had watched through the net curtains the burley black gentleman in an ill-fitting suit walk up the small flight of steps to the front door and knock four times with his knuckles, rather than ring the bell. An ex boxer she suspected, who had lost more fights than he had won, sent on an errand. She opened the door, the man's large frame filling the doorway. "I don't want to buy anything" she said before he could open his mouth. The man was taken aback by the slight figure looking up squarely into his eyes. He then remembered why he was there. "I'm not selling", he said in a deep, un cultured voice. "I've come to collect Mr B's money."</p>
                <p>Ah yes, the money. He wasn't the first to call about that. It had been naive of her to think that Mr B would forget about it so easily. "What's taken you so long", she said, again putting the man off guard. "I have it in the safe in the room at the top, come and help me get it." At which point she turned and led the way up the stairs to the top floor and into the room. "There's the safe. It's a pucker one, with a combination. The problem is that my eyesight isn't what it used to be and I have trouble dialling the numbers. It took me an age to unlock it the other day. You be a good fellow and work the dial while I tell you the numbers." He knelt down in front of the safe so that he could see the numbers on the old dial. Even then he had to bend over so as make out the indistinct figures.</p>
                <p>Mrs W pushed the panel in the wall to release the catch and took out the axe.</p>
