                <h1>How to eat grapes without really trying</h1>
                <p>You know the sort of day that makes you feel you could achieve anything? Well this was such a day. There was a smoothness to the air, a freshness to the light and a brightness to the aromas of the morning. Ben had woken feeling refreshed, following an unusually sound nights sleep. Even the taste of his daily bowl of cereal had a zing to it and he found himself singing in the shower. Luckily no one else was in ear-shot. To be fair, it was a Saturday and he did have plans for the day; plans that such a day as this would make unstoppable.</p>
                <p>You know the sort of day that makes you feel like a fly being swatted and your optimism for the future gets kicked in the direction of pessimism. Well this was such a day. And it was all down to a banana skin! It would be a scene straight out of a comic book if the consequences had not been so serious and the pavement so hard. Ben was walking, almost skipping, down the street in the warm early morning sunshine, thinking how he was going to ask Jean to the dance that evening, marvelling at the new leaves bursting their way out of the rigid branches as though there was no tomorrow, when his heel landed on the offending skin. There must be a law against people discarding bananas, bereft of their pulpy centres, on the public highway. They may be biodegrade, but in the time that it took them to return to the cycle of life, they were a hazard to people; to Ben.</p>
                <p>The bursting buds were suddenly in front of his eyes, rather than above his head.</p>
                <p>The feeling of the pavement pressing back, against the soles of his feet became the lack of resistance of the air.</p>
                <p>The coordinated movements of his arms and legs became flailing and cavorting limbs trying to defy gravity and put his body into the position his mind expected it to be.</p>
                <p>Ben's contact with with the pavement, having failed to cheat gravity, was brutal to say the least. His writhing limbs had resulted in one leg being tucked under his bottom in a position that a yoga teacher would be proud, but one that Ben did not think himself capable. The sharp crack said it all! It wasn't the pain or the indignity of sprawling on his back on the ground; it was the instant images of his plans being thwarted and the humiliation of the countless times that he would be asked to re-tell the story. But the pain soon took the lead and the sounds from his mouth became almost primeval.</p>
                <p>And so it was that the comic stip antics on the pavement resulted in the Cartoon image of a leg in full plaster cast suspended from the ceiling by a series of pulleys. A small crowd soon gathered around the twisted Ben and an ambulance had been called. Someone found a cardigan to fold and put under his head, but the offer of a leather belt for him to bite on was rejected. In Ben's mind the whole episode from the time that he hit the ground to watching his incarcerated leg being pulled towards the ceiling was a bit of a blur. Firstly there was the feeling that his leg was going to explode and then the paramedics who came to him under the trees had given him an injection to relieve the pain. This it had done, but from then on events were as if viewed in a dream. He was conscious of simply grunting in response to questions being asked of him. How the doctors and nurses determined which grunt meant yes and which no he had little idea. Perhaps they learnt from experience. At least they had not amputated his leg or put the wrong leg in plaster.</p>
                <p>He had been given a general anaesthetic while his disjointed leg was reassembled and now as he came out of his mid-morning sleep his only thought was that nurses were supposed to be petite and pretty. Before he really had a chance to muster his thoughts a doctor was at his bedside. Was this the doctor who had admitted him in casualty, or the one who had pushed metal pins into his bones? No matter, the prognosis was not good. A week suspended from the ceiling in this ungainly fashion would be followed by a week of learning how to walk on crutches before he was sent back into the Spring air. He would then be trying to scratch his leg with a knitting needle for at least six weeks. It sounded as though he would need to forgo dancing that evening!</p>
                <p>Ben was still wondering how he was going to pee whilst in his current position when he realised that he should tell someone where he was; his mum, for instance, and his friends Don and Frank. Within half an hour his mother was at his bedside with clean underwear and some grapes. He pointed out that he was wearing NHS pyjamas with one leg cut off and would not need underwear for a week. However, it was the first time that he thought about food, and he realised that he was hungry. Conversation soon dried up, even though there had been no mention of the cause of his injury. His mother was one of those people who accepted how things were and only concerned herself with what now needed to be done. She was on her way to his Uncle Bill's, to get his shopping, and so she hurried off, with the threat of returning later.</p>
                <p>Just as she was walking out so Don appeared at the end of the ward. It didn't look as though his mother noticed him, she already had her shopping list in her hand. Don had a spring in his step that looked familiar. Following a few quips about being plastered and Ben's ability to chase the nurses, Don tucked into the grapes. Between mouthfuls he wrote on Ben's cast. It took him a long time to write just his name. Then he told Ben that he had run into Jean on the way to the hospital and had asked her to the dance that evening. Ben's spirits sank even lower and Don ate some more grapes. By the time that Ben was alone again with his thoughts the unzipped plastic bag on his bedside cupboard held only a skeleton of stalks.</p>
                <p>Before he could wonder at the empty bag, a nurse propped him up with another pillow and a lady, who blushed as she looked at his cast, served him some lunch. At least he thinks it was food. It satisfied his hunger pangs but did little else to lift his spirits. Later, after discovering how he was expected to empty his bladder, his mother came flapping into the ward again with more clean underwear and more grapes; green this time. As she tried to clean his cast with a handkerchief and spittle she said that Uncle Bill had sent his regards and would visit him after the 3:30 at Kempton. She didn't stay long, seeming to be a woman on a mission to wash more underwear. Less than ten minutes later his younger brother arrived, with one of his girlfriends in tow. After a few grunts about his predicament they tucked into the grapes, talking between themselves and drew pictures on his cast, but they soon bored of this, grunted and left.</p>
                <p>Uncle Bill didn't visit that afternoon, but Don and Frank did. They were Disappointed that there are no grapes. "You aught to go easy eating that many grapes in your condition." Frank said. After a few references to banana skins they wrote on his cast and made their getaway. After all, they needed to get ready for the dance that evening. Looking ahead to an evening on his own, broken only by the arrival of the trolley lady, Ben was starting to understand the meaning of the word depression. It wasn't right that men were allowed to be nurses.</p>
                <p>It was a different lady with the trolley this time, but the food didn't look or taste any different. His older brother was a chef in a local pub. Not a Gordon Ramsey or a Heston Blumental, but he did know how to take a portion of steak and ale pie out of the freezer, microwave it and serve it up with some frozen vegetables that had been blanched in boiling water. Since his brother started working in the pub Ben had noticed that his mother was more adventurous with her cooking. She occasionally served rice with their burgers rather than chips and would serve up the occasional spaghetti bolognese with left over cheese grated on the top.</p>
                <p>After his meal he made an arm-aching attempt to read the newspaper that Frank had left. He started at the back, but didn't get further than the latest infidelities of a premier league footballer. So he missed the headlines about an explosion at the factory where he worked and where he had been heading that morning to do some overtime. After a while he fell into a restless sleep that lingered through the night, only to be broken, when he had finally descended into deep sleep, by the trolley lady with something that was probably breakfast.</p>
                <p>Another mail nurse drew the curtains around his bed and helped him with his ablutions. He was starting to feel glad that it wasn't a pretty young nurse after all. He had just been shown how to help alleviate bed sores when his mother returned. It seems that Uncle Bill's horse had come in first and so he had spent the evening in the pub; although he had raised a glass to Ben, who wasn't surprised that another bag of grapes had appeared on the side cabinet. However, he was taken aback when his mother took a brush and a tin out of her bag and started painting out the graffiti on his cast! She told him not touch his cast for an hour, packed away her decorating kit and left. She had Sunday lunch to prepare before her afternoon at the bingo hall. The thought of Sunday lunch did nothing to brighten his spirits and his toes, protruding from the cast, we're getting cold. He should have asked his mother to bring him a sock, rather than more grapes.</p>
                <p>The only thing that could be said about Sunday lunch when it did arrive was that it helped break the monotony of the hospital radio. That was the only free channel on the audio-visual system provided with each bed. He was surprised that advertising had not been plastered on his cast. "Sponsored by Fresh Greens, purveyors of ripe bananas". His second surprise of the day, his cast was now dry, was to be visited by Don and Jean, Frank and a girl he had met at the dance the previous evening, his younger brother with a different girlfriend and his elder brother, the chef, who brought some grapes. The nurse in charge of the ward said there were too many visitors around one bed, but since it was Sunday, and quiet, they could remain as long as they didn't make too much noise. After the initial pleasantries and expression of surprise that his cast was clean they all talked among themselves, mainly about how great the band had been and drew on his cast in between eating grapes.</p>
