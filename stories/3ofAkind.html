                <h1>Three of a Kind</h1>
                <p>I've never subscribed to the idea that bad things come in threes. However, at the beginning of August we 'lost' three things in the space of seven days! Lost may not be the right term, since in at least one case we knew the location of the offending item, it just wasn't where we wanted it to be. The first 'loss' involved a cat. You see, since our dog died in February, our children, who both have a cat, have decided that in addition to us providing off airport parking for Gatwick, an airport taxi service and pre-flight accommodation, we can now also provide cattery services! We had already looked after Sam, our daughter's cat when they went off to Italy for the wedding of a friend, when our son and his Dutch wife brought Connie to us before they went to Holland to visit her parents. Now Connie is more adventurous than Sam (who is also female) and likes to explore.</p>
                <p>We had already decided that we would keep the cats inside, so as to reduce the chance of losing them, and so we were careful to close one door of the front and rear porches before opening the other. Paul and Krista stayed the first night and then were taken to Gatwick. Connie seemed quite settled and we both saw her on the following morning. However, when I got home from work Angela said that she had been hunting for the cat all day, but had still not found her! The conclusion was that she, the cat, was either in the piano or behind the wardrobe in the front spare bedroom, the one that Paul and Krista had used. Now Connie had a collar with a bell and occasionally we could hear a tinkle. But if you were in a room you could not tell from which other room the sound originated.</p>
                <p>Now the wardrobe in the front room is a fitted affair that goes around a corner. In the corner there is void, formed due to the difference between the depth and width of the individual units. However, this void is only 20 centimetres wide, but runs the full two metres in height. These wardrobes were originally bought for this room, but had spent quite some years in our bedroom, when we moved from the front room to a larger room at the rear. However, we had redecorated and re-furnished our bedroom and so moved the fitted wardrobes back into their original location. So I was aware of how they were put together and that within the corner unit there was a narrow gap into the void.</p>
                <p>Needless to say, as I shone a torch into the corner cupboard, so two small eyes peered back at me through the narrow gap! Clearly there was no way that Connie could scale the two metres of cupboard side or wall and so the only option was to dismantle the cupboard, or at least half of it, so as to let her out. I had not planned to spend my evening this way. Not only did I need to empty the cupboards and remove the internal drawers and the cornice, I had to remove the heavy mirrored doors and separate the individual units. Once Connie had been extracted it then took me longer to put the whole assembly back again!</p>
                <p>That evening, Connie came and sat on my lap. She didn't seem any the worse for wear after her day-long incarceration. Needless to say, the opening at the top of the void is now covered over!</p>
                <p>The second 'loss' was not as traumatic, it was just time consuming. We made our usual Saturday visit to my parents and noticed, when my Dad answered the door that he was not wearing his glasses. He looked tired, perhaps because we could see more clearly the red rims around his eyes. It was a fine day and he had been working in the garden. His neighbour had lent him her large garden waste wheelie bin and so he was filling it with prunings and weeds. We normally cut the grass and so I did this while Angela helped prune more shrubs.</p>
                <p>Then, over a cup of tea, I checked his post as I usually do. In order to read something he needed his glasses, but did not know where he had put them. It was the weekend of the Shoreham air show and he had looked at some of the planes flying over through a small pair of binoculars. But to use these he had taken off his glasses and put them in his shirt pocket!</p>
                <p>We searched each room of the house, plus their small conservatory. We looked in his sheds ( he has three) and we scoured the garden. But no sign of his glasses. He said that he had an old pair, but didn't seem able to see very well with them. Our final thought was the wheelie bin! So we found a large sand container that had come from a builder's merchant and gradually removed prunings and weeds from the bin. Half way down we came across his glasses!</p>
                <p>The third 'loss' was a little more traumatic; at least for me. I was picked up from home at seven o'clock in the morning and driven to Heathrow airport; Terminal 5 to be precise. I was due to fly to California for three days of meetings. At the check-in machines I inserted my BA card and confirmed my details and flight. I was then told that I could not be checked in and that I should go to a customer service desk. Now this is usually a good sign since it could mean that you have been upgraded.</p>
                <p>Indeed, this was the case. But then I was asked for my passport. I took it from my shirt pocket and opened it at the photo page to Angela's face peering back! I had two and a half hours before the gate closed for my flight, I lived one and a half hours away and I had the wrong passport! My car had gone and there was no way that a taxi could get me home and back in time. I only had one option, which was to phone home and ask Angela to drive my passport to me. Up the A24, around the M25 and up to Terminal 5. And she had never been to Terminal 5!</p>
                <p></p>My first attempts to call only got through to the answer machine. So I repeatedly called, ignoring the request to leave a message after the tone, until Angela answered. Without any fuss she found my passport and set off with only my verbal instructions on how to get to Terminal 5 and where I would be waiting. Even going into a cafe for a cup of coffee did not make the time pass faster. My journey to Heathrow had taken one and a quarter hours, so after a wait of that time I vented outside and positioned myself at the top of the Departures ramp. After one hour and twenty minutes Angela drove up the ramp, saw me and pulled over. We exchanged passports and a kiss and she drove off. I didn't have the courage to tell her that I had been upgraded!</p>
                <p>I checked in, went though security and straight to the gate, arriving one minute effort they started boarding!</p>
