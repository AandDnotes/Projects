                <h1>The New World</h1>
                <p>The ship juddered as it touched the land. We had arrived at the start of our new lives. We could see the crowds waiting for us to disembark, but there seemed fewer than we had expected. Three ships had left before us, each at one year intervals so as not to over stretch the resources of our new home. Had they all arrived safely? Had the first settlers caught local diseases or found savage creatures? Had they not been able to grow the crops and rear the animals that they brought with them? Perhaps the animals had simply not survived the journey, or perhaps our fellow travellers had not been as lucky as the passengers on our vessel and had not survived the journey. Or perhaps some had moved on to settle other locations. We would know soon enough when we were able to walk and talk with them.</p>
                <p>Cheers rose from the welcoming party as the captain walked down the gangplank, followed by the elders who were mobile. The cheers didn't sound as hearty as we had imagined they would be and there were no banners or bunting. The smiles though were real as people shook our hands and slapped us on the back as they led us to a clearing in the middle of some low buildings. They were built of a type of timber that we hadn't seen before, at least not used as a building material. It was strangely soft to the touch and did not give you confidence that it would withstand gusty conditions, let alone a strong wind. Since we couldn't see the ships that had brought our fellow travellers to our new home we had assumed they'd been cannibalised to make shelters, but they were still not to be seen. All of the buildings, both inside and out, appeared to be constructed of local materials. Even the furnishings and fittings were not recognisable as previously belonging to the ships.</p>
                <p>Before we could ask the questions that were piling up in our heads, our new neighbours insisted that we eat with them. They were cooking over open fires, a novelty for us recent travellers, and the smells were unusual but enticing. As we drew closer to the fires, rather than the carcasses of pigs, sheep or cattle to which we had been looking forward, we could see small, rat-like bodies threaded on to sticks and suspended above the flames. These were presented to us on large leaves, used as plates, accompanied by some form of potato-like tuber that had been cooked in the ashes of the fire. There was little conversation whilst we eat, since our guests tucked in ravenously, using their hands to pull apart the meat and to break open the tubers. A variety of unusual fruits were to follow, mostly brightly coloured and all very sweet. The whole was then washed down with water, flavoured with one of the fruits, drunk from wooden bowls.</p>
                <p>With the food eaten our hosts and new found citizens were looking more contented and so finally the time had come to ask our questions. Small groups had formed around the cooking fires and so the same questions were being asked in each group. I wondered if we were all receiving the same answers. It seems that their journey to the new world had gone well and the passengers of the first ship to arrive were in high spirits when they landed in their new home. The jungle generally went right down to the sea, but they had found a small cove with a little scrub and started clearing land for buildings and for cultivation. However, the animals that had survived the journey had soon died due to lack of feed. There was plenty of water in small streams that ran down to the sea and they had cleared land and sown seed, but the surrounding jungle recaptured the land faster than they could keep it clear. So they had failed to grow feed for the animals and they could not find fodder in the jungle that the animals would eat. Many of the animals were butchered for food before they simply wasted away.</p>
                <p>Once the supplies from the ship had been exhausted the group had resorted to being hunter-gatherers in the jungle. But they lacked knowledge of their new home and the skills needed to find enough food for the number of people that needed feeding. Although the settlers soon learnt which plants were edible, at first it was uncertain how many of them would survive. The only competition for fruits was from a variety of small monkey-like animals and root tubers seemed to be the staple diet of the rat-like animals we had eaten earlier. They told us that these taste better than the monkeys and are easier to catch. However, 'rats', tubers and two or three varieties of fruit was a dispiriting diet, even if they were able to gather enough to satisfy their hunger. Consequently people were undernourished, which led to disputes and violence. In the end, some of the group had gone off into the jungle to set up their own camp, believing that we needed to become one with our new surroundings and not try to change it to our old ways of living. However, nothing had been seen or heard of them since they left nearly a year ago.</p>
                <p>When we asked about the ships they said that the second ship to arrive had been sent off to find land more suitable for cultivation, but had not returned. The third ship had set off in pursuit with a skeleton crew just three months ago, but still nothing had been heard from them. Since they had only taken three months worth of provisions the group was now starting to worry. So that was why we had not seen two of the three ships, but what about the first? Their reply shocked us. It seems that is has been overrun by the jungle, both inside and out!</p>
                <p>They said that anything built from material that had been harvested from the jungle seemed immune from being enveloped by the jungle, thus the crude huts and shelters. The jungle was like nothing they'd heard of back home. It seemed to protect itself from any alien object by engulfing it faster than it could be kept clear. With all able bodied people needed to hunt for food, there was no time to keep the jungle from going where it wanted to go. Consequently the ship was still there, they thought, but plants had grown up around it and through any opening such that it was now not visible. Even items they had brought out of the ship, like tables and chairs, had attracted moss and creeper-like plants that simply swamped them and made them impossible to use. Therefore they had made crude dwellings and furniture out of material from the jungle itself. They had not even managed to maintain a cemetery. It was as if bodies buried in the ground were simply consumed by the jungle.</p>
                <p>During their journey the ship's captain had been in charge, but on their arrival one of the first things they had done was to elect a governing council, including a judiciary. However, the concept of an elected body had soon broken down. The most able at living in this new environment had been followed by others and the original leaders had slowly given in and become followers. The people who had first greeted us as we disembarked where the leaders of the hunting packs and the organisers of building and utility making. As their clothes started to wear out so people found jungle plants from which they could make fibres from which to hand weave cloth and use to stitch together 'rat' and 'monkey' skins. Footwear was their biggest problem since the jungle floor was rough on the soles of the feet. The best hunters and the most skilled crafts men and women had become the most powerful, with the shoe maker at the top of the tree.</p>
                <p>Having enough to eat was one thing, but we were concerned for our health in a new environment. However, it seemed that they were remarkably disease free. Yes, people had died, but is was from old age or from accident rather than illness. Even the most toxic plants only gave stomach pains and a bad attack of diarrhoea. The doctor's role had therefore become more one of first-aider and midwife. Cuts, bruises and broken limbs were the main injuries. They had also found that some of the plants from the jungle produced a sap that seemed to encourage healing and prevented wounds from becoming infected.</p>
                <p>The newly arrived children were over the moon to discover that the community had given up trying to run a school. With so much time being spent on gathering fruit and tubers and catching animals, those old enough to help we're pressed into food gathering. Already they were needing to travel further afield in order to find enough food, and now there would be many more mouths to feed. They had managed to catch 'rats' alive, but they were able to chew their way out of any enclosure that could be built from jungle material. So they had not been able to breed them, only trap, spear and shoot them with crude bows and arrows.</p>
                <p>In fact it seemed that getting around was a problem in itself. Attempts to cut paths through the jungle, so as to extend their hunting and gathering range, had proved fruitless. They had spent more time trying to keep the paths clear than they had gathering fruits and tubers and laying traps. Although the jungle was dense, it was not impenetrable. with a bit of practice it was possible to clamber through the undergrowth without frightening 'rats' and monkeys in the vicinity. The younger, more nimble members of the community, both male and female, tended to be more adept at using roots and branches in the undergrowth as a platform for getting around. There were fears amongst some that the youngsters were becoming quite 'wild'.</p>
                <p>Moving around in the jungle was one thing, but navigating was another. One piece of jungle looked very similar to another and finding traps and your way home could be problematic. Markers were soon overgrown, but there were a few who seemed to have an innate sense of direction and had become the guides of the group. The one marker that did remain was the sea. Their explored area spread farthest in both directions along the coast. Again there was little to distinguish one piece of jungle from the next, but at least navigation was easier.</p>
                <p>Clearly, as newcomers, we all had a lot to learn, and quickly. The first day in our new home was drawing to a close. Tomorrow we would start on the many challenges that faced us. Some of our travelling companions were determined to spend their first night sleeping in the community huts, but the rest of us would return to the ship. Sleep was likely to be restless as we mulled over the stories that we had heard. As se watched, the twin suns began to set over the horizon. I'd never seen Earth, being the third generation born on our journey, but I was starting to feel homesick.</p>
