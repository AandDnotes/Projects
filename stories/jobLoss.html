                <h1>Business skills are never redundant</h1>
                <p>In your mind you went through the possible outcomes of the next few days, including the worst. You thought about the steps that you would take to find gainful employment and even rehearsed some of the words you would utter if the ultimate happened, determined not to break character but to remain calm and composed.</p>
                <p>When you get called into your boss’s office and you see the large brown envelope. When he talks of difficult times and even more difficult decisions, “for the benefit of the company as a whole”, you remain calm, talk coherently and use some of the more appropriate phrases from your mental preparation. But you can’t prevent the sick feeling in the pit of your stomach or the realisation that you haven’t really prepared your family for this event.</p>
                <p>Notification of redundancy is something that I have now experienced twice and I’m sure that a third time would not make it any easier to swallow. But you have responsibilities, you have bills to pay and, most of all, you can’t let the b....... get you down.</p>
                <p>So. How do you handle the loss of your job and only source of financial income for the support of your family? Indeed, what can you do whilst in employment to put yourself in a better position if this mechanism for reducing overhead is activated in your direction?</p>
                <p>Lets deal first with the aftermath of the thunderbolt. Don’t disappear down the pub, spend what little money you might have and justify your sacking by demonstrating weak will. Think of someone that you know in another company and call her. Ask if she knows of any jobs going that might be suitable for yourself. You will probably draw a blank but you will have made a start. You will have kicked back and started doing something positive to retrieve the situation. In fact your first actions should be designed as much to raise your self esteem as to make progress. In practice they will do both.</p>
                <p>Then consider finance. How much does your family spend and on what? What do you actually need to survive? How much cash do you really have tucked away in this account or that Save As You Earn scheme? Do some back of the envelope sums (or use a spreadsheet if you have access to one) and establish just how long you can live without earned income. Even if it does not amount to many months, at least you will know and its fear of the unknown that produces that sick feeling in the stomach.</p>
                <p>Next, simply list all the people that you know in other companies. Ex colleagues, present and past customers, supplier salespersons, someone you met at the institute dinner last year, list them all. Go through any business cards that you tossed into the back of your desk drawer. Look in trade directories for companies that you didn’t even know existed. Now your getting somewhere. This is the source of future employment. Don’t be afraid to ask colleagues for contact names either. Soon they may have you on their list!</p>
                <p>It is said that the majority of jobs are filled without being advertised. Your chance of slotting into one depends upon who you know and who knows you. The first is on the paper in front of you, the second can be enhanced by getting the resource of others behind you. Some people make money out of steering the right person into the right job. You only have to pick up any quality newspaper or trade journal to find recruitment agencies advertising on behalf of their clients and many will be pleased to receive a call from you and to add your details to their computer database. However, companies looking for people with your skills are more likely to contact recruiters who have a knowledge of your industry. So you must contact them too. Ask the personnel department of your (ex) company who they approach for help. Ask colleagues who may have been contacted by head-hunters operating in your field. Agencies working in the general area of your expertise can add more minds to the task but the specialists are more likely to be able to connect you with a suitable opportunity.</p>
                <p>Whether talking to personal acquaintances, general agencies or head-hunters, the most common response will be for them to ask you to send them a copy of your c.v. Professional help can be found to help you produce an effective curriculum vitae but some simple rules can get an adequate c.v. produced quickly. Remember, the intention is to sell yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Make the front page an overview of your experience and skills that can be taken in at a glance.</li>
                  <li>Follow this with personal details but leave salary and benefits to the covering letter. You want to spread your c.v. widely but don’t want to broadcast what you’ve been earning or set expectations.</li>
                  <li>Include details of your out-of-work interests and activities to show that you’re a rounded personality.</li>
                  <li>Elaborate on your skills and experience to put flesh on the bones of the front page.</li>
                  <li>Provide a chronological list of past positions held, with an outline of responsibilities.</li>
                  <li>Use any available word processing facilities to enhance readability and clarity.</li>
                  <li>Don’t make your c.v. so long that it is difficult to get it in the envelope. Unless you’re an Ian Flemming your readers will soon get bored.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In practice a wide ranging c.v. is really only a supplement to the covering letter. If you are responding to a published advertisement or a verbal description of an opportunity, state succinctly in your letter why you are the best person for the job, how your skills and experience match their needs and how your growth potential complements their own.</p>
                <p>But what can you do, whilst gainfully employed, to take some of the pain and stress out of what many consider to be an inevitable part of present day business. There are three main areas to consider, finance, networking and saleability.</p>
                <p>If, when you do your budgeting, you discover that you and your family can survive for a year, even without state help, then immediately a state of inner calm results. You’re not going to be thrown out on the street. You don’t need to take the first lowly job that is offered. You are in control. It thus makes sense to have either cash savings or easily convertible assets that can provide this financial security. Its surprising how quickly a regular saving can provide for that rainy day.</p>
                <p>If one of the keys to unlocking a new job is who you know and who knows you then it is wise to establish as wide a network of contacts as possible. Easier in some jobs than others but if you keep a record of people you meet, not only will you be pleased by the size of your database but you will have immediate access to an important resource.</p>
                <p>Finally there is the question of making yourself more marketable. Can you take advantage of Continuing Professional Development opportunities through your company or professional institute? Would a second language make you more attractive to the market? Can you ask to be involved in areas outside your mainstream work so as to broaden your experience? Rather than watching television every evening would you benefit from playing badminton or joining the local history society? Then, when through the first barrier and you attend interviews, can you take along examples of some of the work that you have done? If you can, it is a good idea to make a collection of non-confidential material (a report with names and figures removed for example) to form a portfolio of skills.</p>
                <p>You have been working in a business environment, communicating with people inside and outside the organisation, identifying and solving problems, planning and monitoring activities. In effect you have developed a range of skills that help you tackle the everyday demands of your work environment. Apply what you have learnt in business to the current problem and, in time, success will be yours.</p>
