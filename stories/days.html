                <h1>One of Those Days</h1>
                <p>You know those days when everything seems to go right? When you wake just before the alarm rings, having slept soundly all night. When the sun is shining, the traffic to work is practically non-existent and you clear more on your to-do list than you have expected, let alone planned. Then you have a fine meal with your family, watch an interesting TV programme and go to bed content.</p>
                <p>Well it wasn’t one of those days! Not that it started badly or gave any particular signs of foreboding. No black clouds or long traffic jams; no e-mails that were especially difficult to handle. Perhaps if I’d been more alert to what was going on around me I would have seen the problems coming and been able to take some evasive action. My excuse is that I was too engrossed in what I was doing. I’m normally very aware of the effect of my actions on others and take great care to ensure that others are not inconvenienced or upset by my actions or words. In fact, people often come to me seeking advice on how they should handle a tricky situation, or ask my help in phrasing some missive that needs to point out the error of someone’s ways without them feeling that they have made a complete mess of things. However, this time I got it very wrong.</p>
                <p>I could actually feel my face reddening and I found it difficult to look people directly in the eyes; a very uncomfortable situation and one to which I was not accustomed. Back-tracking was impossible, I’d worked myself into a corner and now had to take the consequences. It was a case of damage limitation rather than being able to wipe the slate. I really only had two choices, keep my head down and hope that everyone would be too preoccupied with other problems for them to dwell on my discomfort, or admit that I had made a mistake through lack of concentration at a crucial moment and try to move on with a plan to salvage what I could of my reputation. The latter course of action was really the only one with which I felt comfortable. My, how long the day seemed before I battle the longer than usual traffic queues to get home. And therefore I was late! My dinner wasn’t quite yet in the dog but it was a close call.</p>
                <p>On the way home I’d passed a van covered in lip prints as though a giant woman had kissed the sides, leaving lipstick impressions at various angles. There were unlikely to be any kisses this evening. And there wasn’t even anything interesting on the box that could divert my mind from the events of the day. It took a long time to fall asleep. Perhaps tomorrow would be a better day.</p>
