    <a name="BODY1">The music wire</a> used by sailplane modelers to make 
    landing gear and cabin struts is medium carbon steel heat-treated to spring 
    temper or about 45 on the Rockwell C scale of hardness (RC45). On this 
    scale, RC20 is soft, RC45 is tough, and RC60 is hard.</font><a href="#NOTE1"><font face="VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA,GENEVA,SANS-SERIF" size="2" color="#000000"><sup><b>1</b></sup></font></a><font color="#000000"> 
    Tough wire can be bent and cut using the proper tools and techniques, but 
    sometimes it's just too difficult to work with.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="3" color="#000000">One way to soften 
    steel music wire is to heat it, which makes it easy to bend and form. But 
    after heating and forming, the subsequent cooling -- often at an 
    uncontrolled rate -- can make the finished wire too hard or too soft since 
    its hardness is determined by the rate at which it cools. For some parts, 
    the final hardness isn't critical. But a landing gear formed from wire 
    softened too much won't spring back to its original position; and a gear 
    made from wire cooled to a harder than normal state will snap on its first 
    use. To restore the wire to its original specific spring temper, it must be 
    heat-treated a second time and cooled at a controlled rate.</font></p>

    <p><font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="3" color="#000000">To form wire 
    easily, first anneal it; next, form or bend it to the desired shape; and 
    then heat-treat the part back to spring condition -- that is, temper it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="3"><font color="#000000">
    <a name="BODY2">First the wire</a> should be annealed</font><a href="#NOTE2"><font face="VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA,GENEVA,SANS-SERIF" size="2" color="#000000"><sup><b>2</b></sup></font></a><font color="#000000"> 
    at the location to be bent. To anneal it, heat the wire with a torch until 
    it becomes a bright cherry red -- about 1400 degrees Farenheit. Let it cool 
    completely to the touch. Don't quench</font><a href="#NOTE3"><font face="VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA,GENEVA,SANS-SERIF" size="2" color="#000000"><sup><b>3</b></sup></font></a><font color="#000000"> 
    it or blow on it. Just let it cool naturally away from any drafts. The wire 
    should now be in the RC25 soft range, and it will bend easily. After 
    forming, once again heat the wire with a torch until it becomes bright 
    cherry red, but this time quench it -- that is, cool it rapidly by immersing 
    it in room temperature water. Plunge the steel into the water with a 
    twisting, swirling motion to keep water vapor from insulating the wire 
    against the cooling action of the water.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="3" color="#000000">At this point the 
    wire should be very hard, probably above RC60. To test the hardness, try to 
    make a mark on the worked area with a file. The file should slide off 
    without cutting into the steel at all. If it cuts the wire, try the heat and 
    quench cycle again. If the file still cuts the wire, it isn't high carbon 
    steel. Get another piece of wire and start over -- you won't be able to add 
    the necessary carbon to low-carbon steel. When the file test signals 
    success, the wire is ready for the final step, but not for use, because it's 
    very hard and quite brittle, and will probably snap off.</font></p>
    <p><font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="3" color="#000000">The final step is 
    to temper the wire back to the desired hardness. Tempering is a form of 
    annealing but is controlled so that the steel achieves a specific hardness. 
    Start by sanding the wire with steel wool or emery cloth. Then heat it 
    gradually with the torch. Watch for the following colors as a guide: straw 
    color (350 degrees), followed by dark blue (600 degrees), and then medium 
    blue (750 degrees). At this point, remove the wire from the heat and allow 
    it to cool slowly. Don't quench it or blow on it; just let it cool naturally 
    in still air. Once the steel returns to room temperature, it should be at 
    the target RC45 hardness, which has a good spring temper. Try the file test 
    again. You should be able to make a mark now, but only with some effort. If 
    it passes this test, the wire is properly tempered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="3" color="#000000">Besides parts for 
    model planes, tempered music wire can also be used to make special purpose 
    tools. Instead of tempering to 750 degrees (medium blue), stop at the straw 
    color stage. The wire will be at about RC60, which is still very hard, but 
    not brittle. Wire at this temper can be used to drill wood and plastics, and 
    most aluminum and copper.</font></p>

    hardness testing</i>, named after Stanley Rockwell who made his first 
    testing machine in 1921, is a general method for measuring the bulk hardness 
    of metallic and polymer materials. Although hardness testing does not 
    measure performance properties, hardness correlates with strength, wear 
    resistance, and other properties.</font></p>
    <p><font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="2"><font color="#000000">Rockwell 
    hardness testing is an indentation testing method. An indenter is impressed 
    into the test sample at a prescribed load to measure the material's 
    resistance to deformation. A Rockwell hardness number is calculated from the 
    depth of permanent deformation of the sample after application and removal 
    of the test load. Various indenter shapes and sizes combined with a range of 
    test loads form a matrix of Rockwell hardness scales that are applicable to 
    a wide variety of materials. The Rockwell B and C scales are used for 
    metallic substances. </font><a href="#BODY1"><font color="#000000">(Back to
